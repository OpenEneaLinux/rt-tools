Linux Real-Time Tools
=====================

This repository contains a collection of tools for achieving real-time
performance in Linux. It is currently focused on CPU isolation using
cgroups/cpuset.

For information about license, see LICENSE file.

The following tools are available:

Executable  | Description
------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
partrt      | Partition the CPUs into two sets: <br> One set for real-time applications and one set for the rest. The goal for this tool is to achive tickless execution on the real-time CPU set. <br> See man page found in "doc" sub-directory for more information.
count_ticks | Counts number of ticks that occur when executing one or several shell commands. Uses ftrace for this.
bitcalc     | Bit calculator, helper application for partrt script.

Installing
----------
Make a new build directory. If this build directory is *build root* and the
directory where this file is found is called *src root*, do the following
to install:

    cd <build root>
    cmake <src root> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<prefix>
    make install DESTDIR=<destdir>

The installation directory will be
    <destdir>/<prefix>/bin
for binaries, and
    <destdir>/<prefix>/share/man
for man pages.

If -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH is not given, then the default value is:
    /usr/local

The default value for DESTDIR is the empty string.
